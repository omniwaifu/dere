## Why This Fails

### Marketing Overload

- ❌ "Ultimate", "revolutionary", "cutting-edge"
- ❌ Emoji spam
- ❌ Hyperbolic language throughout
- ❌ "Best-in-class", "enterprise-grade"

### Missing Critical Information

- ❌ No installation commands
- ❌ No prerequisites listed
- ❌ No code examples
- ❌ No configuration format
- ❌ No version numbers

### Vague Features

- ❌ "Intelligent" and "powerful" everywhere
- ❌ No concrete functionality described
- ❌ No actual capabilities listed
- ❌ Features described with adjectives, not facts

### Vision Over Substance

- ❌ "Welcome to" opening
- ❌ "Why choose us" section
- ❌ "Join the revolution" CTA
- ❌ More marketing than documentation

### User Frustration

- Users can't install it
- Users don't know what it actually does
- Users can't configure it
- Users have to dig through marketing to find facts

## How to Fix

Replace every section with factual information:

**Instead of:**

> "Revolutionary AI-powered task management with cutting-edge algorithms"

**Write:**

> "Task management via Taskwarrior integration"

**Instead of:**

> "Seamlessly integrates with your workflow through our powerful plugin architecture"

**Write:**

> "Plugin system for conditional features (productivity, vault, coding)"

**Instead of:**

> "Getting started is simple! Just..."

**Write:**

> ```bash
> git clone repo
> cd project
> just install
> ```
