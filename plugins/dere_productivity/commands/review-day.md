---

Start a guided daily review session using the `evening-review` skill.

Walk me through my evening review ritual:

1. **Gather Today's Data**:
   - Activity summary (actual time spent)
   - Tasks completed today
   - Calendar events attended
   - Morning plan (if it exists)

2. **Compare Plan vs Reality**:
   - What did I plan to do?
   - What did I actually do?
   - Time variance and reasons

3. **Activity Analysis**:
   - How I spent my time (by application/focus type)
   - Peak productivity periods
   - Context switches and distractions
   - Comparison to previous days

4. **Capture Wins**:
   - What went well today?
   - What am I proud of?
   - What worked in my process?

5. **Identify Challenges**:
   - What didn't go as planned?
   - Why did that happen?
   - Any surprises or interruptions?

6. **Extract Learnings**:
   - Technical learnings
   - Process improvements
   - Personal insights
   - Patterns to remember

7. **Tomorrow Preview**:
   - Quick look at tomorrow's calendar
   - Pending tasks for tomorrow
   - Suggestions for planning

8. **Process Incomplete Tasks**:
   - Reschedule unfinished work
   - Adjust priorities if needed
   - Stop any running task timers

9. **Closure**:
   - Summarize accomplishments
   - Gratitude moment
   - Sign off properly

Provide the review as markdown for my daily journal.
