# History Domain

Historical events, causal narratives, institutional evolution, counterfactuals.

## Formalization

Causal chains with evidence, counterfactual reasoning, source analysis, periodization.

## Thickness Criteria

1. **Causation vs correlation distinguished** - Did X cause Y or just precede it?
2. **Evidence sources cited** - Primary vs secondary, reliability assessed
3. **Counterfactual considered** - What if this hadn't happened?
4. **Generalizability assessed** - Is this a pattern or a one-off?

## Interrogation Questions

- "Is this causation or just sequence? What's the mechanism?"
- "What's the evidence? Primary sources? How reliable?"
- "What would have happened otherwise? What's the counterfactual?"
- "Is this a repeatable pattern or a unique contingency?"
- "What alternative explanations exist? Why reject them?"
- "Who wrote the sources? What's their perspective/bias?"

## Thin vs Thick Examples

**Thin**: "The printing press caused the Reformation"

**Thick**:

```
Printing press and Reformation:
- Claim: Press was necessary (not sufficient) for Reformation's rapid spread
- Mechanism: Pamphlets cheap to produce; Luther's 95 Theses printed in weeks; vernacular Bible accessible
- Evidence: Print run data shows 300,000+ copies of Luther's works 1517-1520; literacy correlation with Protestant adoption
- Counterfactual: Pre-press heresies (Cathars, Lollards) contained locally; suggests spread requires mass communication
- Alternative explanation: Political opportunity (German princes vs Rome) enabled tolerance of heresy
- Synthesis: Press necessary for speed and scale; political opportunity necessary for survival
- Generalizability: Technology enables social movements but doesn't cause them (cf. internet and Arab Spring)
- Source note: Eisenstein's "Printing Press as Agent of Change" is seminal but criticized for technological determinism
```

## Verification

- Is the mechanism plausible?
- What do contemporary sources say vs later interpretations?
- Does the counterfactual reasoning hold?
- Are you telling a just-so story or tracing actual causal chains?
