# Science Domain

Empirical claims, hypotheses, evidence, experimental methods, natural phenomena.

## Formalization

Falsifiable hypotheses, experimental designs, evidence quality assessment, effect sizes, confidence intervals.

## Thickness Criteria

1. **Claims falsifiable** - What observation would refute this?
2. **Evidence type and quality noted** - RCT, observational, meta-analysis, case study
3. **Confounds acknowledged** - What else could explain this?
4. **Effect sizes, not just direction** - How big? With what confidence?

## Interrogation Questions

- "What observation would prove this wrong?"
- "What's the evidence? RCT, observational, or theoretical?"
- "What are the main confounds? How are they addressed?"
- "What's the effect size? The confidence interval?"
- "Has this replicated? What's the publication bias risk?"
- "What's the mechanism? Is it understood or just correlated?"

## Thin vs Thick Examples

**Thin**: "Exercise improves mood"

**Thick**:

```
Exercise and mood:
- Claim: Acute aerobic exercise (20-40min, moderate intensity) reduces depressive symptoms
- Evidence: Meta-analysis of 25 RCTs (Cooney et al. 2013), SMD = -0.62 (moderate effect)
- Mechanism: Endorphin release, BDNF upregulation, HPA axis modulation (partially understood)
- Confounds: Expectation effects, social contact, time outdoors (partially controlled via waiting-list controls)
- Limits: Effect smaller in clinical depression; long-term adherence is the bottleneck
- Falsifiable by: RCT showing no difference vs active control with matched expectations
- Replication: Generally robust; effect size may be inflated by publication bias
```

## Verification

- Is the effect size clinically/practically meaningful?
- What's the study quality (blinding, randomization, sample size)?
- Does the mechanism make biological sense?
- What's the generalizability beyond study population?
