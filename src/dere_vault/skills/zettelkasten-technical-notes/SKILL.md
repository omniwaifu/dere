## Workflow

### Creating Technical Analysis
1. Research current version and documentation
2. Find performance benchmarks (official or third-party)
3. Identify trade-offs and limitations
4. Compare with alternatives
5. Provide actionable code examples
6. Link to related technologies

### Analysis Framework
Use this structure:
1. **What**: Technology description
2. **Why**: Problem it solves
3. **How**: Implementation approach
4. **Trade-offs**: Pros/cons/limitations
5. **When**: Use cases and anti-patterns
6. **Alternatives**: What else could work
7. **Verdict**: Recommendation with context

### Style Guidelines
- **Be honest**: Don't repeat marketing claims
- **Be specific**: "2x faster" means nothing without context
- **Be practical**: Focus on real-world usage
- **Be current**: Note versions and dates
- **Be critical**: Analyze trade-offs, not just features

## Quality Standards

### Good Technical Notes
- **Actionable** - Someone could use this tech from your note
- **Honest** - Covers limitations, not just benefits
- **Contextual** - Explains WHEN to use, not just HOW
- **Current** - Version and date tracked
- **Connected** - Links to related tech and concepts

### Red Flags
- Marketing copy without critical analysis
- No version information
- No performance data or trade-offs
- Missing use cases
- No code examples for relevant tech
- Outdated info presented as current

## Technical Note Types

### Framework Analysis
Focus: How it works, when to use, patterns

### Infrastructure/Platform
Focus: Deployment, scalability, operations

### Tool/Library Reviews
Focus: Capabilities, integration, comparison

### System Analysis
Focus: Architecture, technical reality vs marketing

### Performance Studies
Focus: Benchmarks, optimization, bottlenecks

### Integration Guides
Focus: How to connect technologies

## Archival Policy

Mark as `status: archived` when:
- Technology is deprecated
- Major version makes note obsolete
- Superseded by better alternative

Don't delete - keep for historical context. Add note:
```markdown
> **Archive Notice**: This analysis is for [version]. See [[newer-note]] for current version.
```

## Permanent Note Extraction

Technical notes can generate permanent notes:

Example:
- Technical note: Detailed infrastructure analysis
  â†’ Permanent notes:
    - [[marketing-claims-vs-technical-reality]]
    - [[build-vs-buy-decision-framework]]
    - [[proprietary-vs-open-source-optimization]]

Look for generalizable concepts that apply beyond specific technology.

## Integration with Projects

When using tech in projects:
- Link project note to tech note
- Add project to "Use Cases" section
- Document project-specific learnings
- Update tech note with real-world experience

# FastAPI Async Performance Patterns

## Overview

FastAPI is a modern Python web framework with native async/await support and automatic API documentation. Best for building high-performance async APIs when you need type safety and developer productivity.

**One-liner**: Use FastAPI when you need async Python APIs with excellent DX; stick with Flask if you need mature ecosystem or don't need async.

## Technical Details

### Architecture
- Built on Starlette (ASGI framework)
- Pydantic for data validation
- Automatic OpenAPI schema generation
- Native async/await throughout

### Key Components
- **Router**: Path operation decorators
- **Dependency Injection**: Reusable dependencies
- **Background Tasks**: Fire-and-forget tasks
- **WebSocket**: Native WebSocket support

## Code Examples

### Basic Async Endpoint
```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
import httpx

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/users/{user_id}")
async def get_user(user_id: int):
    # Async HTTP client for non-blocking I/O
    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
        response = await client.get(f"https://api.example.com/users/{user_id}")
        return response.json()
```

## Performance/Trade-offs

### Performance Characteristics
- **Throughput**: 20k-30k req/s (simple endpoints, single worker)
- **Latency**: p50: 5ms, p95: 15ms, p99: 50ms
- **Memory**: ~50MB base + ~10MB per worker
- **Scalability**: Excellent with async I/O workloads

### Trade-offs

**Pros:**
- Excellent async performance
- Best-in-class developer experience
- Automatic API docs (OpenAPI/Swagger)
- Strong type safety with Pydantic
- Modern Python features (type hints, async/await)

**Cons:**
- Smaller ecosystem than Flask/Django
- Async programming has learning curve
- Less mature for complex auth/admin needs
- Breaking changes between minor versions (pre-1.0)

### When to Use
- **Use when**:
  - Building async APIs with I/O-bound operations
  - Need automatic API documentation
  - Want type safety and validation
  - Team comfortable with async Python

- **Avoid when**:
  - Simple CRUD with no async needs (Flask simpler)
  - Need battle-tested admin interface (Django better)
  - Team unfamiliar with async patterns
  - Require absolute API stability (pre-1.0 has changes)

## Alternatives

### Flask
- Pros: Mature, huge ecosystem, simpler mental model
- Cons: Sync-first, manual API docs, less type safety
- **Decision**: Choose Flask if you don't need async or want maximum ecosystem

### Django + DRF
- Pros: Batteries-included, amazing admin, ORM
- Cons: Heavier, async support still maturing
- **Decision**: Choose Django for full-stack web apps with admin needs

## Implementation Notes

### Installation
```bash
pip install "fastapi[all]"  # includes uvicorn, pydantic, etc.
```

### Common Gotchas
- Don't mix sync and async database clients
- Use async HTTP clients (httpx, aiohttp) not requests
- Beware of blocking operations in async endpoints
- Background tasks run in same process (use Celery for heavy work)

### Security
- Built-in OAuth2/JWT support
- CORS middleware included
- Request validation via Pydantic
- Still need to secure endpoints yourself

Remember: Technical notes are decision-making tools. Focus on trade-offs and context, not just features. Be honest about limitations.
