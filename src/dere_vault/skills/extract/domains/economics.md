# Economics Domain

Markets, incentives, mechanisms, resource allocation, institutional analysis.

## Formalization

Causal diagrams, equilibrium conditions, mathematical models, mechanism descriptions, payoff structures.

## Thickness Criteria

1. **Directional causation** - X causes Y (not just "X and Y are related")
2. **Equilibrium/dynamics specified** - What state does the system settle into? How?
3. **Incentive structure explicit** - Who gains/loses? What behaviors are encouraged?
4. **Empirical predictions derivable** - What observable data would confirm/refute this?

## Interrogation Questions

- "Draw the causal diagram - what causes what, under what conditions?"
- "What's the equilibrium? How does the system get there?"
- "Who benefits? Who pays? What perverse incentives might emerge?"
- "What empirical observation would falsify this claim?"
- "What market failure or friction does this address/create?"
- "What happens at the margins? When agents are price takers vs makers?"

## Thin vs Thick Examples

**Thin**: "Supply and demand determine price"

**Thick**:
```
Price mechanism:
- Equilibrium: P* where Qd(P*) = Qs(P*)
- Adjustment: excess demand → price rises → Qd falls, Qs rises → convergence
- Conditions: perfect information, no transaction costs, homogeneous goods
- Breaks when: externalities (price doesn't reflect true cost), information asymmetry (adverse selection), market power (price manipulation)
- Welfare: consumer surplus + producer surplus maximized at P*
- Prediction: price controls below P* → shortage of (Qd - Qs)
```

## Verification

- Is causation directional or merely correlational?
- What's the counterfactual (what if this mechanism didn't exist)?
- Are incentives stable (no one wants to deviate unilaterally)?
- What's the empirical track record?
