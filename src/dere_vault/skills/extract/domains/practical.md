# Practical Domain

Personal systems, habits, procedures, heuristics, life decisions.

## Formalization

Procedures, if-then rules, checklists, decision triggers, review mechanisms.

## Thickness Criteria

1. **Trigger conditions explicit** - When exactly does this apply?
2. **Steps actionable** - Could someone else follow these?
3. **Failure modes noted** - How does this go wrong? How do you notice?
4. **Review mechanism specified** - When do you check if this still works?

## Interrogation Questions

- "When exactly should I do this? What's the trigger?"
- "Could I hand this to someone else and they'd do it right?"
- "How will I know if this isn't working? What's the feedback loop?"
- "When do I review whether this system still makes sense?"
- "What's the minimum viable version? What can I drop?"
- "What assumption is this built on? When does it break?"

## Thin vs Thick Examples

**Thin**: "Exercise regularly"

**Thick**:
```
Morning exercise protocol:
- Trigger: Alarm at 6:30 AM; clothes laid out night before
- Procedure:
  1. Out of bed within 5 seconds of alarm (no snooze)
  2. Change into exercise clothes (pre-staged)
  3. 20 min minimum: run if sunny, bodyweight if not
  4. Shower by 7:15
- Failure modes:
  - Skip chain: If I miss, next day 50% likely to miss → never allow 2 days consecutive
  - Injury spiral: If pain, switch to walk; don't stop entirely
  - Winter fade: Light therapy lamp at 6:25 to compensate for darkness
- Review: Monthly: Am I actually doing this? Energy levels? Mood?
- Assumption: I have morning control; breaks when travel or illness
- Minimum viable: 10 min walk counts; the habit matters more than intensity
```

## Verification

- Could you actually follow this tomorrow?
- What's your track record with similar systems?
- Is the review mechanism actually scheduled?
- Have you identified the likely failure point?
