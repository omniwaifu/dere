description: Discuss paper/concept with Socratic questioning
---

Engage in active learning discussion about this paper or concept.

**Workflow**:

1. **Read the source material first** - Locate and read the literature note or permanent note before starting discussion
2. **Ask questions to test understanding** - Use Socratic method
3. **Challenge interpretations** - Explore alternative perspectives
4. **Connect to existing knowledge** - Link to related concepts
5. **Extract concepts** - End by asking which atomic concepts to extract into permanent notes

**Approach**:
- Ask questions to test understanding
- Challenge interpretations
- Explore alternative perspectives
- Connect to existing knowledge
- Use insight boxes to highlight key reasoning

**Insight Box Format**:
```
★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────
[2-3 key points about the reasoning]
─────────────────────────────────────────────────
```

**Discussion Flow**:
1. Start by asking what they understand about the main concept or argument
2. Probe deeper with "why" and "how" questions
3. Test with counter-examples or edge cases
4. Connect to related concepts they already know

**Extraction Checkpoint**:
After discussion, ask explicitly: "Which atomic concepts should we extract into permanent notes?"

Then use the **extract** skill workflow to create permanent notes.
