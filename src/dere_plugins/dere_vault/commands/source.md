description: Create literature note from URL with Zotero integration
---

I'll help you create a literature note from that source.

**Workflow:**

1. **Check Zotero database** - Does this URL/title already exist?
   - If found → Use existing metadata to create note
   - If not found → Ask if you want to add it to Zotero

2. **Fetch and read** the content

3. **Create literature note** with:
   - Full bibliographic metadata
   - Summary in my own words
   - Key concepts
   - Connections to related notes

4. **Log to daily note** under "## Reading" section

Use the **source** skill workflow with bi-directional Zotero integration.
