# Capture Skill

Quick capture of fleeting thoughts, tasks, and daily reflections into daily notes.

## When to Activate

- User mentions: "daily note", "journal", "today", "reflection", "capture"
- Morning/evening planning
- Quick thought capture during work
- Daily review or logging

## Core Workflow

1. **Create or open daily note** (`YYYY-MM-DD.md` in Journal/)
2. **Add timestamped entry** with appropriate section (Tasks, Notes, Log)
3. **Capture quickly** - don't over-process, that comes later
4. **Tag** for processing hints (#process, #extract, #todo)

## Key Principles

- **Speed over perfection** - fleeting notes should be fast
- **Process within 1-2 days** - use extract skill to create permanent notes
- **Separate concerns** - tasks → projects, insights → permanent notes, sources → literature notes

## Integration

- After capture → Use **extract** skill to process into permanent notes
- For external sources → Use **source** skill instead
- For project work → Tag with project name for **research** skill
