# Philosophy Domain

Conceptual analysis, metaphysics, epistemology, ethics, logic.

## Formalization

Formal logic, precise definitions, argument structure (premises → conclusion), thought experiments with explicit moves.

## Thickness Criteria

1. **Key terms precisely defined** - What's in and out of the concept
2. **Argument structure explicit** - Premises stated, logical form clear
3. **Counterarguments addressed** - Strongest objections engaged
4. **Scope/domain specified** - Where does this claim apply?

## Interrogation Questions

- "Define [key term] precisely - what's included, what's excluded?"
- "State the argument as premises → conclusion"
- "What's the strongest counterargument? How would you respond?"
- "Is this a conceptual truth, empirical claim, or normative judgment?"
- "What's the scope - does this apply universally or conditionally?"
- "What thought experiment tests this? What intuition does it pump?"

## Thin vs Thick Examples

**Thin**: "Consciousness is subjective experience"

**Thick**:
```
Consciousness (phenomenal):
- Definition: there is something it is like to be X (Nagel criterion)
- Includes: qualia, felt experience, first-person perspective
- Excludes: mere information processing, functional access, reportability
- Argument for irreducibility:
  P1: Physical facts are third-person accessible
  P2: Consciousness facts are first-person only
  C: Consciousness ≠ physical facts (explanatory gap)
- Counterargument: P2 conflates epistemology with ontology
- Response: even if ontologically physical, explanation remains gapped
- Scope: applies to creatures with nervous systems (uncertain below)
- Implications: hard problem remains even if functionalism true
```

## Verification

- Are definitions non-circular?
- Is the argument formally valid?
- Does the strongest objection survive steelmanning?
- Are intuitions pumped reliably across thinkers?
