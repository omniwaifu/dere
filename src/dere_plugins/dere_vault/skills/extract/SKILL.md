# Extract Skill

Extract atomic concepts from fleeting/source notes into densely-linked permanent (evergreen) notes.

## When to Activate

- User mentions: "extract", "permanent note", "concept", "synthesize from"
- Processing daily notes (after 1-2 days)
- Creating evergreen notes from sources
- Identifying reusable ideas

## Core Workflow

1. **Review source material** (daily note, literature note, existing permanent notes)
2. **Identify atomic concepts** - single idea per note
3. **Write in your own words** - demonstrate understanding
4. **Link densely** - connect to existing permanent notes
5. **Set status** - #growing, #mature, or #stable

## Key Principles

- **Atomicity** - one concept per note, fully self-contained
- **Own understanding** - explain as if teaching someone
- **Link liberally** - connections create knowledge
- **Evergreen** - timeless insights, not time-bound observations
- **Reusability** - idea should work in multiple contexts

## Quality Checks

**Good permanent note:**
- Single focused concept
- Makes sense without source material
- 3+ links to other permanent notes
- Clear, descriptive title
- Written in own words

**Bad permanent note:**
- Multiple concepts bundled
- Requires reading source to understand
- Orphaned (no links)
- Vague title ("thoughts on X")
- Copy-pasted content

## Integration

- From daily notes → Use **capture** skill first
- From external sources → Use **source** skill first
- For cross-note synthesis → Use **research** skill
