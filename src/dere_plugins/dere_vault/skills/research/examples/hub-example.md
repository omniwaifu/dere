# Hub: Decision-Making Frameworks

## Overview

Decision-making frameworks provide structured approaches to evaluating options and making choices under uncertainty. This hub collects frameworks applicable to software engineering, architecture, and product decisions.

Good frameworks balance rigor with practicality - they add structure without creating analysis paralysis. The best frameworks make implicit trade-offs explicit and force consideration of constraints.

This area emerged from repeated pattern across technical and product decisions: having explicit frameworks improves decision quality and makes rationale clearer for future review.

## Core Concepts

Fundamental frameworks that define this area:

- [[Build vs Buy Decision Framework]] - Evaluating custom vs off-shelf solutions
- [[Trade-offs Between Control and Adaptation]] - Tension in system design
- [[Reversibility as Decision Criterion]] - Weight decisions by reversal cost
- [[Regret Minimization Framework]] - Long-term perspective on choices

## Supporting Concepts

Ideas that enhance or refine core frameworks:

- [[Decision Documentation Patterns]] - How to record rationale
- [[Deferring Decisions Until Last Responsible Moment]] - Timing strategy
- [[Satisficing vs Optimizing]] - When "good enough" beats "perfect"
- [[Option Value in Uncertain Environments]] - Keeping options open

## Domain Applications

Frameworks applied to specific domains:

**Architecture Decisions:**
- [[Monolith vs Microservices Framework]]
- [[Database Technology Selection Criteria]]
- [[API Design Philosophy Trade-offs]]

**Team & Process:**
- [[Meeting Structure Decision Matrix]]
- [[Hiring Bar Calibration Framework]]
- [[Technical Debt Priority Ranking]]

**Product:**
- [[Feature Prioritization RICE Framework]]
- [[Build vs Partner vs Buy for Features]]

## Common Patterns

Cross-cutting insights from multiple frameworks:

- [[Explicit Constraints Improve Decisions]] - Why listing assumptions helps
- [[Decision Reversibility Reduces Risk]] - Architecture for changeability
- [[Quantifying Qualitative Trade-offs]] - Making soft factors comparable

## Practical Tools

Concrete implementations:

- [[Decision Doc Template]] - Standard format for recording choices
- [[Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)]] - Lightweight documentation
- [[Trade-off Matrix Generator]] - Tool for comparing options

## Sources

Key literature notes informing this area:

- [[Ahrens - How to Take Smart Notes (2017)]] - Decision workflow
- [[Kahneman - Thinking Fast and Slow (2011)]] - Cognitive biases
- [[Evans - Domain-Driven Design (2003)]] - Strategic design decisions
- [[Hohpe - Software Architect Elevator (2020)]] - Architecture trade-offs

## Open Questions

What's not yet fully understood:

- How do you calibrate decision frameworks across different domains?
- When does framework overhead outweigh benefit?
- How to balance data-driven vs intuition-driven decisions?
- What patterns emerge from decision retrospectives?

## Gaps to Explore

Areas for development:

- [ ] More frameworks for team/people decisions
- [ ] Better tools for quantifying soft factors
- [ ] Patterns for decision-making under extreme uncertainty
- [ ] Framework for when to create vs use existing frameworks
