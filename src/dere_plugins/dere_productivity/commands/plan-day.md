description: Comprehensive morning planning ritual for the day ahead
---

Start a guided daily planning session using the `morning-plan` skill.

Walk me through my morning planning ritual:

1. **Yesterday Review** (if available):
   - Show activity summary from yesterday
   - Compare what I planned vs what I actually did
   - Highlight wins and challenges

2. **Today's Calendar**:
   - Show all calendar events for today
   - Identify free blocks for work
   - Note any constraints (meetings, appointments)

3. **Task Landscape**:
   - Show tasks due today (urgent)
   - Show high-priority tasks
   - Summarize other available work

4. **Set Intention**:
   - Ask me: What's my main goal for today?
   - Ask about energy/time constraints

5. **Propose Plan**:
   - Create a structured daily plan considering:
     - Calendar constraints
     - Energy levels (morning vs afternoon)
     - Task priorities
     - Time estimates
   - Include time blocking suggestions
   - Add focus protection strategies

6. **Refine**:
   - Let me adjust the plan
   - Create calendar blocks if I want
   - Start first task when ready

Provide the final plan as markdown I can reference throughout the day.
