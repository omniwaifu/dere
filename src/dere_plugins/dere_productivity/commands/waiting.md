description: Show tasks waiting on external factors

Use the `get_waiting_for` MCP tool to show all tasks I'm waiting on (delegated items, external blockers, deferred tasks).

Group by:

- **Person/Blocker**: Who or what am I waiting for?
- **Date**: When do I need to follow up?
- **Project**: Which projects are blocked?

Suggest any items that might need follow-up or clarification.
