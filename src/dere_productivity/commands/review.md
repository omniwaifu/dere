description: Run GTD weekly review
---

Let's do a GTD weekly review. Use the `weekly_review` MCP tool to gather all the data, then guide me through:

1. **Inbox**: Process any remaining inbox items to zero
2. **Completed**: Review what was accomplished this week
3. **Projects**: Check project health and identify stalled ones
4. **Next Actions**: Ensure all projects have clear next actions
5. **Waiting For**: Review delegated items and external blockers
6. **Habits**: Check recurring task completion and broken streaks
7. **Someday/Maybe**: Scan for anything that's become relevant

Provide insights and recommendations based on the review data.
