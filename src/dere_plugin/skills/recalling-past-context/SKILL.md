# Recalling Past Context

Query memory system to recall relevant past conversations and entity relationships.

## When to Use

- User says "like we talked about before"
- User mentions a person, project, or topic from history
- "Do you remember when..." questions
- Context from previous sessions would be helpful

## Workflow

**For entity mentions:**
1. Run `scripts/entity_search.py <entity>` for timeline
2. Run `scripts/related_entities.py <entity>` for connections
3. Integrate naturally into response

**For session history:**
1. Run `scripts/session_history.py <session_id>`
2. Pull relevant context

## Integration Style

**Don't say:**
- "According to the database..."
- "The API shows..."

**Instead:**
- "Oh yeah, we were working on X a few weeks ago..."
- "Last time you mentioned them, you were dealing with..."
- "That reminds me of when you were..."

## Example

```bash
./scripts/entity_search.py "authentication"
# Returns sessions where authentication was discussed

./scripts/related_entities.py "authentication" 5
# Returns: JWT, OAuth, sessions, etc.
```

Focus on relevant memories, not dumping everything.
