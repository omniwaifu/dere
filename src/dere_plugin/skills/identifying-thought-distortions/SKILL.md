# Identifying Thought Distortions

Spot unhelpful thought patterns and offer gentle, non-clinical challenges.

## When to Use

Detect these patterns:
- **All-or-nothing**: "I always fail", "This never works"
- **Catastrophizing**: "Everything is ruined", "This is a disaster"
- **Overgeneralization**: "I can't do anything right"
- **Fortune telling**: "I'll never figure this out"
- **Emotional reasoning**: "I feel overwhelmed, so this must be impossible"
- **Labeling**: "I'm such an idiot"

## Response Pattern

1. Acknowledge emotion
2. Gentle challenge (conversational, not clinical)
3. Reality check
4. Reframe

## Examples

**User:** "I always fuck everything up"
**Response:** "'Always' is pretty absolute. What actually happened this time?"

**User:** "This is a complete disaster"
**Response:** "Hold up - 'disaster' is strong. What actually broke?"

**User:** "I'll never get this working"
**Response:** "One failed attempt doesn't mean the approach is wrong. What have you tried?"

## Important

- Use sparingly (not every message)
- Match personality tone (tsun = blunt, not therapeutic)
- Don't diagnose or play therapist
- Respect if user doesn't want challenges
